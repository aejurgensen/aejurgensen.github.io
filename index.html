        <h3>Assignment 4</h3>
        <p class="p1">My block visualizing annual commodity prices over time (data from <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/commodity-markets">the World Bank</a>):</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p class="p1">Note that the World Bank provided the data in a multi-sheet excel spreadsheet, so I saved the data from the appropriate sheet to a separate CSV file.  Also note that I tried 
        bar chart races for both prices by weight and prices by contract size using the 'real' prices instead of the 'nominal' ones, in which the prices were all in terms of 2010 US dollars, but these
        versions were even less interesting to look at.

    <h3>Assignment 11</h3>
    <p class="p1">My blocks for black and white hat visualizations, and my remade "misleading viz from the media."</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/aejurgensen/raw/0bcdf4961c585bf433ef9f93e68862df/?raw=true" target="_blank">black-hat visualization</a> 
            using mushroom data from the 
            <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom" target="_blank">UCI ML Data Reposirot</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Two variables (odor and edibility) are combined and displayed along the x-axis, making 
                    the tick labels impossible to read, and the data confusing.  The two variables should have 
                    been encoded separately for clarity (e.g. only one on the x-axis and the other as color).
                </li>
                <li>The bars don't occur in any sensical order.</li>
                <li>The bars are all filled with yellow, a difficult color to distinguish on a white 
                    background since there is no distinct stroke around the bars.
                </li>
                <li>There are no annotations or tooltips to indicate the actual values of the bars, nor 
                    are there any horizontal lines in the background to help guide the user's eye as they
                    try to "read" the values of the bars.</li>
                <li>The x-axis is not labeled and the categories are not obvious.</li>
                <li>The source of the data is not provided.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>My <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/aejurgensen/raw/75aab9c136f035741018cd815f3b44be/?raw=true" target="_blank">white-hat</a> visualization using the same mushroom data.
            This visualziation corrects the problems of the black-hat version:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Only a single variable (odor) is displayed along the x-axis and the second 
                    variable (edibility) is encoded separately as color.
                </li>
                <li>Annotations with values are provided above each bar.</li>
                <li>The odor groups are ordered from the one with the tallest bar to the one with the shortest.</li>
                <li>The y-axis ticks begin at 0.</li>
                <li>The y-axis is labeled.</li>
                <li>A legend is provided for color.</li>
                <li>The color red associated with "poisonous," the dangerous category.</li>
                <li>The source of the data is provided.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>My <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/aejurgensen/raw/115b18ab0290c5c8a89b9d5ed751148d/?raw=true" target="_blank">improved 
            version of the following misleading chart</a> displayed by Fox News, captured by 
            MediaMatters.org, and discussed in an 
            <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-charts-tricks-data-2012-11" targtet="_blank">article by 
                Business Insider</a> (which is where I found it).</li>
            <ul>
            <li><img src="https://i.insider.com/50b62c0cecad04c66e000014?width=590" alt="misleading fox news graph"></li>
            <li>Most importantly, I started the y-axis of the bart chart <emph>from 0</emph>! 
                The original version made the changes between the quarters look more drastic 
                than they really were.</li>
            <li>I remade the 3-D bars as 2-D.  The 3-D rendering of the bars gave them
                the appearance of being taller (and the amounts they represented being greater)
                than was actually the case.
            </li>
            <li>I removed the nonsensical horizontal lines that weren't associated with any 
                of the values of the y-axis tick marks, and opted instead to add annotations
                with the actual values above each of the bars.
            </li>
            <li>I changed the title from "Federal Welfare Received in US," which sounds like it 
                should be an amount in dollars, to "US Welfare Recipients," which better communicates 
                that the chart is displaying numbers of people.
            </li>
            <li>I removed "M" from the y-axis tick labels and added instead "(millions)" to
                the y-axis label itself so that the tick labels are shorter.
            </li>
            <li>I simplified the y-axis label from "Number of Americans" to "Citizens."</li>
            <li>I changed x-axis tick labels to a shorter abbreviated form that is common in 
                business so they didn't need to wrap onto a second line (though the originals 
                probably weren't <emph>misleading</emph>, they were annoying). </li>
            <li>I provided my own source for the data, and did so in a way that communicates the 
                uncertainty about the data itself.  (Note that the US Census Survey is only conducted
                every ten years, so it wouldn't have had quarterly data for 2009, 2010, and 2011.
                 The US Census <emph>Bureau</emph>, however, conducts many different surveys on a variety 
                 of schedules, so perhaps Fox News meant the USCS and just didn't specify which survey 
                 the data was actually from?)
